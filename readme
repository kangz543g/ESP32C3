The ESP32-C3 with PSRAM and W25Q128 configuration typically refers to a setup using the 
ESP32-C3 microcontroller, which is a powerful, low-power system on chip (SoC) based on 
the RISC-V architecture. Here's a description of each component in the setup:

ESP32-C3:

Microcontroller: The ESP32-C3 is a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) SoC, ideal for
 IoT applications.

Architecture: It uses the RISC-V architecture, making it more cost-effective and 
energy-efficient compared to its predecessors (which use the Xtensa architecture).

Processing Power: It typically operates at speeds of up to 160 MHz, with a 32-bit width
 for general-purpose processing.

Connectivity: It supports Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE 5.0), making
 it highly versatile for wireless communication.

Memory: The ESP32-C3 typically has 384 KB of SRAM (static RAM) and 4 MB of flash memory 
(integrated or external, depending on the specific model).

* PSRAM (Pseudo Static RAM):

Additional RAM: PSRAM is a type of dynamic RAM (DRAM) that behaves similarly to SRAM but is
 cheaper and offers higher storage capacities for embedded systems.

Use Case: The PSRAM in an ESP32-C3 setup typically extends the device's RAM capacity for 
handling more memory-intensive operations, such as graphics, buffering large datasets, 
or running more complex applications.

Capacity: It's common to have 2MB or 4MB of PSRAM integrated into certain ESP32-C3 modules, 
giving the chip more flexibility for more complex operations and multi-tasking.

* W25Q128:

Flash Memory: The W25Q128 is a Flash memory chip made by Winbond, with a capacity of 128 MB.
 It uses the SPI interface to communicate with the microcontroller.

Speed and Reliability: Flash memory like the W25Q128 is non-volatile, meaning it retains 
data even when the power is off. It's used for storing larger amounts of data, such as files,
 code, or other persistent information.

SPI Interface: It communicates with the ESP32-C3 via the SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
 bus, providing high-speed data transfer.

Summary of the setup:
The ESP32-C3 serves as the core microcontroller with low power, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 
capabilities.

PSRAM is added to enhance memory capacity for more demanding applications.

The W25Q128 provides 128 MB of flash storage for persistent storage, making this setup ideal 
for projects requiring significant memory space and fast data access.

This combination of ESP32-C3 with PSRAM and W25Q128 provides a powerful, flexible, and scalable
 solution for a wide range of IoT applications, particularly those requiring wireless 
 communication, local data processing, and large data storage.


How to use
Ensure the SPI PSRAM chip pins are properly connected with your MCU board. E.g the PSRAM is 
connected with below GPIOs of ESP32C3, and don't forget VCC and GND pins:

CS1:  GPIO9  // PSRAM64H(8MB)
CS2:  GPIO10 // W25Q128(16MB)
MOSI: GPIO6    
MISO: GPIO5
SCLK: GPIO4
